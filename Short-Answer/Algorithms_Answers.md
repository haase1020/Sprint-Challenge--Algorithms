#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) while and for loops are runtime complexity of O(n).

b) nested for loops (while is a type of for loop) have a runtime complexity of O(n^2).

c) runtime complexity of O(1) since it will take the same amount of time despite the input size.

## Exercise II
